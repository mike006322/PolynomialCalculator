"""
Algebra module for advanced algebraic computations.

This module provides advanced algebraic operations including:
- Lattice operations and enumeration
- LLL (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov√°sz) lattice reduction
- Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
- Finite field constructions
- Vector and matrix norms
- Lattice enumeration algorithms

Key Functions:
    lll_reduction: LLL lattice reduction algorithm
    gram_schmidt_numpy: Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process
    euclidean_norm: Euclidean vector norm
    weighted_frobenius_norm: Weighted Frobenius matrix norm
