Wolfe conditions is inherent in backtracking line search

we know the following for nice enough f:
if we ensure p_k is not perpendicular to grad(x_k), i.e. cos(theta_k) >= delta > 0
compute cos(theta_k) in each iteration, and turn p_k in the steepest descent direction if
needed (cos(theta_k) < delta)
and alpha_k statisfies the wolve conditions
then we have a globally convergent algorithm

we can perform angle tests (|cos(theta_k)| > delta) and subsequently "turn" p_k to ensure global convergence
however, this will slow down convergence rate
they brak quasi newton methors which are important for large problems
