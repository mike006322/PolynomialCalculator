Currently this project can do the following with a single variable polynomial:
- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide
- find GCD of two polynomials
- find degree

Features I would like to add or see added:
- compute exact zeros to polynomials of degree 1,2,3 and 4 via formulas on coefficients
- compute exact zeroes on polynomials of higher degrees if they meet certain criteria
- analyze and compute zeroes using Newton's method
- create a GUI
