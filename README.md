# PolynomialCalculator

By participating in this project we can practice our mathematics and programming skills.

### Similar projects:
- Sympy
    https://github.com/sympy/sympy

- http://cocoa.dima.unige.it/ written in C++ and CoCa language

- jasymchat - Computer Algebra System written in Java (won't run on phone, seems defunct)

Other projects don't emphasize the GUI.
Instead they offer lists of useful commands as options for the user to run.

### Near-term goals:
- code algorithm to find Gr√∂bner basis
- code solution to third degree polynomials in one variable
- code solution to fourth degree polynomial in one variable
- have solutions display symbolically
- option to plot single-variable polynomials
- create a GUI with Python

### Longer-term goals
- web GUI
- Mobile app
