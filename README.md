# PolynomialCalculator

By participating in this project we can practice our mathematics and programming skills.

### Features

- Polynomial addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, gcd
- Supports polynomials over field of characteristic > 0
- Supports multi-variable polynomials
- Can solve degree 1 and 2 single-variable polynomials
- Support for constructing finite fields with polynomials

### Near-term goals:
- implement 'factor' algorithm to factor over polynomials over finite fields
- implement algorithm to find Gr√∂bner basis
- implement solution to third degree polynomials in one variable
- implement solution to fourth degree polynomial in one variable
- allow for coefficients to be over abstract fields
- option to plot single-variable polynomials
- create a GUI with Python

### Longer-term goals
- web GUI
- Mobile app
